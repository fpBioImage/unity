Ray marching for rendering 3D noise in Unity 3D. Requires Unity 4.6.0 pro

Issues
* The volume sometimes renders incorrectly when the cube volume is scaled incorrectly.

Usage
Open Scenes/scene to see a sample.

1. Set your volume target size under Volume Width/Depth/Height. It's not recommended to go above 256 256 128 unless you have a lot of ram.
2. Drag all your slices (sorted alphanumerically when started) into the Slices
3. Adjust clipping using the clipping plane percentage or the clipping plane objects
